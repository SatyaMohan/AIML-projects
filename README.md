# AIML Projects
Some of my data science projects covering important topics in Machine Learning and Deep Learning  
  
### 01. Supervised Learning  
**Task:** Identifying potential customers for loans  
**Description:** Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression, KNN algorithm and SVM algorithm in order to select the best performing one.

### 02. Ensemble Techniques  
**Task:** Predicting the term-deposit subscription  
**Description:** Leveraged customer information of bank marketing campaigns to predict whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not. Different classification algorithms like Decision tree, Logistic Regression were used. Ensemble techniques like Random forest, XGBoost were used to further improve the classification results.

### 03. Unsupervised Learning  
**Task:** Classifying silhouettes of vehicles  
**Description:** Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.

### 04. Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning  
**Task:** Predicting the Strength of high performance concrete  
**Description:** This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

### 05. Recommendation Systems 
**Task:** E-Commerce Product Recommendation Systems  
**Description:** This project involved building recommendation systems for Amazon products. A popularity-based model and a collaborative Filtering model were used and evaluated to recommend top-10 products for a user.

### 06. Neural Networks  
**Task:** Implementing a Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers  
**Description:** SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

### 07. Computer Vision  
**Task:** Face mask segmentation  
**Description:** Predict and apply masks over the faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and apply a segmentation mask on the face.

**Task:** Face Recognition  
**Description:** Face recognition deals with Computer Vision a discipline of Artificial Intelligence and uses techniques of image processing and deep learning. The objective of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.  

### 08. Natural Language Processing  
**Task:** Movie review sentiment classification  
**Description:** The objective of this project is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of a IMDB movie review.

**Task:** Sarcasm Detection  
**Description:** The goal of this hands-on project is to analyse the headlines of the articles from news sources and detect whether they are sarcastic or not.
